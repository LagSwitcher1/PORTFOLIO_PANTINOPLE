<h1>ICT E-PORTFOLIO</h1>
<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p class="CHAPTER"> 
If I were asked, "What was the most memorable time of your life?" I would say the school year 2023-2024.<br>
I met so many great people, had greate experiences, and learnt one way or the other. I grew as a person.<br>
I made mistakes, I made advancements, I made achievements, I made amendments.<br>
I wan't to share this journey with you as a person, not just a student.</p>

<p class="IMG"> <img src="FAITH.jpg" border="10" style="width:55%;"> </p>

<p class="TITLE"> CHAPTER 1: "THIS CLASSROOM IS MY FAMILY."</p>

<p class="CHAPTER">
One of the first pictures taken on the first quarter of the school year.<br>
It hasn't even been more than a month yet I've already grown attached to these people.<br>
So many familiar faces yet so much to explore...</p>

<p class="IMG"> <img src="Teachers_day.jpg" border="10" style="width:55%;"></p>

<p class="TITLE"> CHAPTER 2: "TEACHER'S ARE OUR SECOND PARENT."</p>
	
<p class="CHAPTER">
Time goes by when you're having fun.<br> 
It's so refreshing to be surrounded by those who support you, especially the open-minded kind.<br> 
"Happy Teacher's Day!" We chanted, maybe this wasn't so bad.</p>

<p class="TITLE"> CHAPTER 3:"WE WORK TOGETHER, AS ONE."</p>

<p class="CHAPTER"> So many memories yet so many more to make, this was one of them.<br> 
With such little amount of time left to spare, our entire class became one to finish our task.<br> 
The "VPOP" and pageant was one of the many commendable achievements of our class, where it symbolizes unity and faith.<br>
We put aside our differences made big changes.</p>

<p class="TITLE"> CHAPTER 4: "SPOTLIGHT ON THE STAGE." </p>

<p class="CHAPTER"> Time was passing by so quick but I don't feel like leaving.<br> 
Another mark on this class' history as we all took the stage and performed our hearts out.<br> 
With proper planning, management, practice, and especially joy.<br>
We gave life to now what they call the "Variety Show".</p>

<p class="IMG"> <img src="magazine_cover.jpg" border="9" style="width:55%;"> </p>

<p class="TITLE"> CHAPTER 5: "READY? SET... ACTION!" </p>

<p class="CHAPTER"> Just one of the recent performance tasks that was assigned during asynchronous.<br> 
"La Traviate" A romantic opera that inspires with it's main actor; Fanny Salvini Donatelli.<br> 
Truly an icon who took over the stage and the heart of her audience.</p>

<p class="TITLE"> CHAPTER 6: "OUR SECOND MOTHER, OUR GUARDIAN ANGEL." </p>

<p class="CHAPTER"> If angels were to take the form of a human, it would be her.<br> 
Ms. Gia, our wonderful advisor and to be honest, the best of the best.<br> 
There was never a dull moment around her, her classes were just as fun as her personality.<br>
If there was one thing 9-Faith could agree with it's that we all love our advisor.</p>

<p class="IMG"> <img src="film_making.jpg" border="10" style="width:55%;"> </p>

<p class="TITLE"> CHAPTER 7: "ONE OF THE MANY MORE TO COME." </p>

<p class="CHAPTER"> One of the proudest moments of my life.<br> 
Just right after the variety show, ms. Shen announced that our film had reign champion.<br> 
I'm eternally grateful for my wonderful groupmates especially my film partner, Donn.<br>
He played the role as my bestfriend and in reality he did become one of my friends.<br>
It's overall just amazing.</p>

<p class="TITLE"> CHAPTER 7: "MY ONE TRUE GIFT." </p>

<p class="CHAPTER"> In film an actor played my bestfriend but did you know?<br> 
I'm even more grateful for the bestfriends I made in my own story.<br>
...And I would love to thank them, for everthing.</p>
